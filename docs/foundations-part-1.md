# Module: Foundations Part 1 - Setup & Voice Workflows

## Overview

**The Core Skill: Voice → Text → AI**

This module is fundamentally about mastering **mobile speech-to-text workflows** so you can work with AI tools entirely from your phone. AI tools need text input, and typing on mobile can be slow. By getting comfortable converting your voice to text, you unlock the ability to:
- Capture ideas and questions naturally while on the go
- Create detailed prompts for AI without thumb-typing paragraphs
- Feed voice notes directly into NotebookLM as searchable, analyzable sources
- Work faster and more intuitively than you ever could with a keyboard
- Record thoughts on the go

**What You'll Do:**
- Install and sign in to core apps on iPhone: NotebookLM, ChatGPT
- Create your master NotebookLM notebook for the course portfolio
- **Master voice-to-text capture**: Use ChatGPT voice mode, Claude voice mode, and iOS voice transcription to go from speech → prompts → AI responses → NotebookLM
- Watch and capture the introductory AI Fluency sections and add them as sources; try Study Guide
- Upload voice notes as audio sources in NotebookLM and see them transcribed automatically
- Record reflections using voice and turn them into structured notes

**Why This Matters:**
Once you're fluent in voice-to-text workflows, you can do research, planning, and creative work from anywhere, no laptop required. This is the foundation that makes everything else in the course possible on mobile.

## Step 0: Installing the tools

### iPhone setup: NotebookLM
The Notebook LM app can be buggy, and not always intuitive to figure out how to upload some files. A workaround is to use a browser such as Chrome or Safari, and request the desktop site, that allows you to use the native Notebook LM interface. 
- App (iOS): [NotebookLM on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-notebooklm/id6737527615)
- Requirements: iOS 17 or later; Google account
- Steps:
  1. Install the app from the link above
  2. Open NotebookLM and tap "Sign in"
  3. Sign in with your Google email address
  4. Allow notifications and Files/Photos access if you plan to import sources from your phone

### iPhone setup: ChatGPT
- App (iOS): [ChatGPT by OpenAI](https://apps.apple.com/app/chatgpt/id6448311069)
- Requirements: iOS 16.1 or later; OpenAI account
- Steps:
  1. Install the app from the link above
  2. Open ChatGPT and tap "Log In" (or "Sign Up" if new)
  3. Sign in with your OpenAI email (use the same email you typically use for AI tools)
  4. Optional: Enable voice and microphone if you want hands-free Q&A

- Talk instead of type (iPhone):
  1. In the ChatGPT app, tap the Voice Input icon to start a voice conversation
  2. If prompted, allow Microphone access and choose a voice
  3. Speak your question; ChatGPT will reply out loud

### iPhone setup: Claude
- App (iOS): [Claude by Anthropic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/claude-by-anthropic/id6473753684)
- Requirements: iOS 16.0 or later; Anthropic account
- Steps:
  1. Install the app from the link above
  2. Open Claude and sign in with your Anthropic account (or create one)
  3. The app syncs with your web chats, so you can continue conversations across devices

- **Voice Mode** (Full conversation with Claude speaking back):
  1. In the Claude app, tap the **voice mode icon** (sound wave symbol next to the microphone)
  2. Choose from available voice options to personalize your experience
  3. Speak naturally - Claude will respond with voice and show key points on screen
  4. Use controls: Up arrow (send), Stop square (interrupt), X (exit voice mode)
  5. Seamlessly switch between text and voice modes within the same conversation

### OPTIONAL iPhone setup: Otter (transcription)
You might find that you can do all you need using the Apple Voice Memo app too, which
does basic transcription. See how you get on. If it doesn't work well enough, try Otter.
Otter is a transcription app that is good at recognising your voice, and good with punctuation.

- App (iOS): [Otter: Transcribe Voice Notes](https://apps.apple.com/app/otter-transcribe-voice-notes/id1276437113)
- Requirements: iOS 15 or later; Otter account
- Steps:
  1. Install the app from the link above
  2. Open Otter and tap "Sign Up" (or "Log In" if you already have an account)
  3. Create an account with Google/Microsoft/email and verify your email
  4. Allow Microphone access; optionally enable notifications
  5. Optional: Add the Otter widget for quick recording from the Home Screen

## Course Orientation: Create Your AI-Generated Video Guide

### Get the Full Picture First
Before diving into tasks, let's get NotebookLM to create a personalized video overview of your entire foundation course.

We use NotebookLM because it acts as your central, source-grounded research partner. Unlike general AI tools, NotebookLM focuses specifically on the documents, transcripts, and voice notes you upload, ensuring its answers and summaries are always based only on _your_ course materials. This makes it the perfect tool for studying specific content and building a portfolio. Critically, it turns unstructured voice notes into searchable, analysable text by transcribing them automatically. Plus, it generates personalised learning materials like Study Guides and AI podcasts (Audio Overview) based on everything you've added.

**Step 1: Add Your Course Materials**
1. **Download and add Foundation modules** to your NotebookLM notebook:
   - Add this current document: "Module - Foundations Part 1 - Setup & Voice Workflows.md"
   - Add the next module: "Module - Foundations Part 2 - Delegation in Practice.md"
   - You can copy-paste the content or upload the files directly by downloading them from here https://github.com/howzat/ai-research-onboarding

**Step 2: Generate Your Personal Course Video**
1. Once both foundation modules are added as sources
2. **Click "Video Overview"** in NotebookLM
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for NotebookLM to generate your personalized AI video
4. **Watch your course overview** - this gives you the big picture before starting

**Step 3: Generate Your Personal Course Podcast**
1. Once both foundation modules are added as sources
2. Click the pencil icon to choose your options, I suggest using Default length and the Deep Dive Format
3. **Click "Audio Overview"** in NotebookLM
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for NotebookLM to generate your personalized AI podcast
5. **Listen to your course overview** - this gives you the big picture before starting
6. **Ask a question** -  use the "Interactive" mode to ask the hosts a question about the course!
	1. "What is the first task, remind me what it was and what i'm supposed to learn?"

**Why This Works:**
NotebookLM will create a natural conversation between two AI hosts discussing YOUR specific course content. They may explain:
- What you'll learn in both foundation modules
- How the 4D framework connects to your tasks
- Why voice workflows and delegation matter
- What to expect from the exercises ahead
- Review before starting Part 2
- Shows you how AI can create personalised learning materials

AI is non-deterministic, what you get will change subtly every time you generate an audio overview. That can sometimes be very frustrating!

## Step 1: Capture Your First Learning Sources 
**Start here:**
1. Open the Anthropic AI Fluency course page
   - Link: [Anthropic AI Fluency - Delegation Module](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations)
2. Create a Skilljar account or sign in
   - Click "Sign In" (top right). If new, choose "Create Account," complete the form, and verify your email
3. Enroll in the course
   - On the course page, click "Enroll" (or "Sign in to enroll"), then "Start Course"
4. Watch and capture video + transcript for all content up to (but not including) the Delegation section. Specifically capture:
   - Introduction to AI Fluency
   - The AI Fluency Framework
   - Why do we need AI Fluency?
   - The 4D Framework
   - Deep Dive 1: What is Generative AI? (optional)
   - Generative AI fundamentals (optional)
   - Capabilities & limitations (optional)
5. After each section, copy the video URL (or lesson text/transcript if available). If a video URL isn’t accepted by NotebookLM, paste the lesson text/transcript instead
6. Open NotebookLM and create your first notebook: "AI Fluency Certification Journey"
7. Add the transcripts/lesson text for the sections above as sources (one per section is fine)

**Quick NotebookLM Practice:**
Once you've added these AI Fluency sections as sources, ask NotebookLM:
- "Summarise the 4D framework as described in the materials"
- "List two capabilities and two limitations of generative AI covered in the sections"

Click on the citations to see where NotebookLM pulled the information from. This is your first taste of source-grounded AI – it only tells you what's actually in your materials.

**Generate Your Study Guide:**
- Click on NotebookLM's "Study Guide" feature
- Answer at least 3 quiz questions it generates from the AI Fluency sections you added
- Save any terms from the glossary you didn't know

## Task 1 (Part 1): Voice Capture Warm‑Up

### Goal
Practice voice capture across tools and get the output into NotebookLM.

**Step 1: Try voice with each tool**
1. ChatGPT app: tap the voice icon and ask 1 quick question e.g.
	1. e.g. "Most interesting/horrible/scary local historical fact near me?"
	2. Where is a great cheap place for us to eat near my location (you might need to say where you are)
	3. Tell the app where you are, and get it to plan you a night out with something to eat and a nice walk - get it to ask you questions about what it should include and prioritise
2. Claude app: tap the voice mode icon (sound wave symbol) and ask 1 question using full voice conversation - 
3. Voice memo: record a brief note about what you've learned from the two conversations, and add it to Notebook LM. Give it a prefix like "Answers Task 1"

**Step 2: Get outputs into NotebookLM**
- ChatGPT/Claude: figure out how to get a summary or a transcript, or the entire recording from these apps into Notebook LM
- Voice memo: save to Files (.m4a) and upload as a source (use web with Desktop Site if the app upload isn’t available)
- Add titles, e.g., "Answers Task 1 - ChatGPT voice Q&A", "Answers Task 1 - Claude voice

**Using Voice Memos**
  - Record with the built‑in "Voice Memos" 
  - Then there are several options to share with Notebook LM
  - **Share the voice note directly**
	  - **Important:** Give the note a meaningful title, this will be what source will end up being called in Notebook LM
	  - Hit the `...` on the note and select the share icon, you'll need to find Notebook LM in the share options to start the share to Notebook LM
	  - When Notebook LM opens, choose the Notebook (The AI Onboarding Research Notebook)
	  - The audio should appear in Notebook LM
  - **Use the Transcript**
	  - Hit the ... on the note and select Copy Transcript 
	  - Go to Notebook LM and Choose Add Source
	  - Choose Copied Text
	  - Paste the text and then lookout for non-obvious blue text that says "Paste text here" - clicking this text is the only way to dismiss the keyboard and see the Add button. 
	  - Add the text
  - After upload, NotebookLM can process audio sources; see Google’s help for audio features: [NotebookLM Audio Overview](https://support.google.com/notebooklm/answer/16212820)

## Week 1 Reflection & Certification Progress

### Part 1: Voice Conversation Challenge

Goal: Use voice with both tools and archive the outputs in NotebookLM.

- ChatGPT (voice): Over the next few days, ask at least 5 questions. After each turn, copy both your question and ChatGPT's answer into a doc and add it to NotebookLM as a source (e.g., "Foundations 1 - ChatGPT Voice Q&A #1–5").
- Claude (voice mode): Over the next few days, ask at least 5 questions using voice mode. After each turn, copy both your question and Claude's answer into a doc and add it to NotebookLM as a source (e.g., "Foundations 1 - Claude Voice Q&A #1–5").

Tips:
- Keep prompts specific (one task each); keep each exchange brief
- Use clear titles and tags so you can find these later in NotebookLM
- Ask the same question to both AIs using voice mode, which gave a better response, and does this change depending on the question?
- Compare voice interaction quality: ChatGPT's voice conversation vs Claude's voice mode

Reflection: record a quick voice note on what felt different between tools and what you'll change next time; add to NotebookLM
