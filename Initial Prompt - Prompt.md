**Prompt**  
I want to design a beginner-friendly, task-based introduction to AI tools for my research assistant. They are learning about research, but doing research on the emerging AI landscape and as a practical side effect; how to use Notebook LM as a means of sharing research output. 

She is a student, primarily a mobile user, and needs a gentle, engaging, scaffolded way of learning about AI and how to structure research and output. The aim of the course is to give a solid foundation on how to think about using AI, when and what for, and how to capture the research in Notebook LM (we can also consider other tools such as  Notion if that better suits the research output). The lessons should be modular, and taken in any order, but with a recommendation that doing the AI fluency certification first. In each lesson, we’ll help learn some core prompting skills, such as meta prompting, or enriching. As we introduce more tools, we can suggest more sophisticated work flows.

The course should be designed so that each week expects some output to be recorded in NotebookLM (or Notion). Over the course, the student should use and learn the core capabilities of Notebook LM (it is a goal of the course).

The course uses Notebook LM in each lesson, and relies on some core skills, so first of all I would like to introduce those. But they don't need to be completed all at once. They could be broken down into smaller lessons. Since the course is modular, we could recommend that she completes one part of the AI fluency course as part of other lessons. That way it's not overwhelming, and we can keep each lesson engaging.

The course should:

1. Teach structured thinking about AI using frameworks like Anthropic’s AI fluency [https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations)   
2. Cover the AI landscape briefly: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, MidJourney, Veo, using TAAFT and other discovery tools  
3. Emphasise research tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, NotebookLM, Notion AI) for her future research tasks.  
4. Be divided into lessons/sections (e.g. Thinking about how to use AI, Image Creation with AI, Research with AI.  
5. Include tasks for each lesson that she can do one at a time, with a clear “definition of done” (e.g. produce an image in MidJourney, summarise an article in NotebookLM, reflect on what worked/what didn’t).  
6. Weave NotebookLM in gradually — first as a log for notes, then as a tool to upload sources, then as a way to query and summarise.  
7. Help build skills in meta prompting and getting the best from AIs  
8. How to review and critically think about the AI output to spot hallucinations  
9. Final output: She should have a well-structured NotebookLM notebook(s) or Notion spaces that captures her learning, experiments, reflections, and outputs from each tool. Be prepared to undertake complicated research tasks by structuring the approach and executing it using AI tools.

Here are some suggestions for the spread of AI tools which may help familiarise her with what’s possible.

* Text & research AIs: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Notion AI  
* Image & video AIs: MidJourney, DALL·E, Runway, Pika, Veo  
* Application building: Replit, Lovable, Vercel  
* AI discovery tools: TAAFT (to learn how to evaluate new tools)  
* AI assistants: Notion AI, Gemini App  
* Speech-to-text: Otter, Whisper, Google Recorder  
* Music AIs: Suno, Udio, Boomy, AIVA  
* Core research environment: NotebookLM, Notion

Over the course of the sessions we should scaffold a lesson that provides an example workflow, such as:

A capstone lesson showing how to chain tools together: speech-to-text → refine in ChatGPT/Claude → enrich with Perplexity → capture & summarise in NotebookLM.

Some suggestions for inclusion on the course:

Get the student to create a personal project and to design their own lesson. Create a brief like this one, planning the tools that they would like to use, and then execute that lesson. An example might be to create a card game on her phone, create a new song, an AI music video, or create an app on the internet.

**Analysis Phase**  
First, let's review the features of Notebook LM and ensure that we’re exploring it’s capabilities and how to use it for research. This will allow us to think about how we’d weave it into our lessons.

Look at other courses that might be commercially available and see if they contain useful ideas that we might adopt in our course content.

Some research would be useful AI on tools that could be used from a mobile, on the go,  to help do research on the go, maybe capturing web pages, taking photos, speech to text. Recommended tools that I may have missed that could be considered frontier, or best in class.

Think very deeply about how we might structure the tasks to meet our outcomes. We need to price each task too, and add login details. 

**Implementation**

Create a lesson plan with:

1. Lesson title.  
2. Learning goal.  
3. Tasks/activities (mobile-friendly).  
4. Definition of done.  
   1. Prompt used  
   2. Tools chosen  
   3.   
5. How NotebookLM is used in that lesson (or suggestion on how to capture the output).  
6. Suggested tools  
7. Cost of the tool, how to log in, how to share the output

## Module-Based Curriculum Overview

**Foundation Track** (Complete first, in order):
- **Module: Foundations Part 1 - Setup & Voice Workflows**: Install core tools, voice interfaces, NotebookLM setup, AI Fluency basics
- **Module: Foundations Part 2 - Delegation in Practice**: Travel planning, verification exercises, first AI creations, critical feedback

**Core Skills Track** (Complete after Foundation, any order):
- **Module: Description - Visual Creativity & Image Generation**: MidJourney/DALL·E prompting, style iteration, ethical considerations
- **Module: Discernment - Source-Grounded Research**: Perplexity citations, NotebookLM Q&A + Study Guide, source evaluation
- **Module: Diligence - Synthesis & Long Context**: Claude for long inputs, NotebookLM Mind Map + Audio Overview, synthesis skills

**Applied Workflows Track** (Complete after Foundation, any order):
- **Module: Delegation & Description - End-to-End Research Workflow**: Audio → transcribe → refine → fact-check → Briefing Doc pipeline
- **Module: Description - Video & Multimedia Creation**: Runway/Pika video generation, adding audio, ethical considerations
- **Module: Delegation - Mobile Productivity**: Gemini app, ChatGPT voice, Notion mobile, Video Overview creation
- **Module: Description & Diligence - Build Something Small**: Replit/Lovable micro build, test-driven prompting, artifact deployment

**Capstone Track** (Complete after Foundation + 3 other modules):
- **Module: All 4Ds - Personal Project & Portfolio**: Plan/execute personal project, verified ethical use, comprehensive 4D reflection

Each module braids four threads: AI Fluency (4D), Prompting skill, NotebookLM capability, and a creative/applied task. This avoids front-loading theory while ensuring steady, hands-on progress.

### NotebookLM Repository Requirement

- Every module: add at least 2 factual, citable sources to NotebookLM (e.g., Anthropic AI Fluency lesson video/transcript, official docs, reputable articles).
- Use NotebookLM features throughout: Study Guide (self-quiz), Q&A with citations, and progressively Mind Map, Audio/Video Overview, Briefing, FAQ, Timeline.
- Treat NotebookLM as the study vehicle for the AI Fluency certificate: generate Study Guides from the Anthropic materials and track progress in the notebook.

### Tool-Specific Prompting Requirement

- Each module includes a tool-specific prompting source and 3–5 line summary (e.g., OpenAI text best practices for Foundation modules; Midjourney Docs for image modules; Perplexity help for research modules; Gemini prompting for mobile module). Learners must read, save the source in NotebookLM, and apply at least one technique in that module's tasks.
